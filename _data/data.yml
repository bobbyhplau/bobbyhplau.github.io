career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a self-learned programmer looking to break into a new career field. After
      refining my skills at a web development bootcamp, I'm eager to join a team and
      make a career of my passion. I have experience in the past of meeting with clients,
      translating their desires, and building a product that meets their needs and I know
      that these skills will help me in my future career as a Junior Developer.

education:
    - degree: Web Development Bootcamp
      university: Lighthouse Labs
      time: 2019
      details: |
        The intensive bootcamp helped teach me the skills needed for me to become
        a professional developer. They provided me mentorship and lessons that help
        patch holes in my programming knowledge and gave me the opportunity to practice
        programming in a team.

experiences:
    - role: Property Manager
      time: 2017 - Present
      company: Self Employed
      details: |
        I was the first point of contact whenever a tenant had a problem. This could
        include a complaint they had about their neighbours, or something inside the
        property has broken down. Whenever this happened, I would have to work quickly
        to resolve the issues, many times within the same day. I also maintained the
        premise, including landscaping and maintenance. I also help with finding new
        tenants for clients.

    - role: Sales Associate
      time: 2011 - 2017
      company: Hing Fat Renovation
      details: |
        I worked closely with clients to make their kitchen dreams come true.
        My responsibilities include meeting with clients to discuss their wants
        and needs and help translating it into a finished product. In my role as
        a sales associate, I was also responsible for managing the company's
        relationships with suppliers, being knowledgable in their line of products
        and how their goods can be used to build cabinets according to new trends,
        and establish new relatonships with new suppliers. During my time as a sales
        associate, I was tasked with converting their payroll and inventory system
        from one that was paper-based to online.

    - role: Executive
      time: 2019 - Present
      company: Richmond Dodgeball League
      details: |
        Volunteer position at the Richmond Dodgeball League. I work as part
        of a team to help run the league smoothly with responsibilities
        including solving disputes among players, arranging for supplies to
        be available at each location, scheduling teams, and managing statistics.
        Whenever I see a way for the league to run more smoothly, I try to make
        it happen such as by creating a new application to manage scoring as well
        as an application to help scheduling.
